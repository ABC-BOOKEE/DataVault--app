# DataVault
Data Vault is a decentralized cloud storage platform built on IPFS. It allows users to store and access their data in a
secure and private way. Data Vault is different from traditional cloud storage services in a few key ways. First, it is
decentralized, which means that there is no single point of control. This makes it more difficult for governments or
corporations to censor or access your data. Second, DataVault uses encryption to protect your data. This means that
your data is scrambled so that it cannot be read by anyone who does not have the encryption key. Third, Data Vault is
transparent, which means that you can see who is storing your data and where it is stored.
If you are looking for a more secure and private way to store your data, Data Vault is a great option.
